# MineFury

If you've wound up in this github repo, I genuinely hope it's because you too have
discovered that Minecraft is a massive POS game. It's a game that your wonderful
children have discovered before they are truly capable of critical thought, and now
all they want to do is run *stuff* in it that makes no sense to you.

You've come to the right place.

I setup MineFury because my son found a bunch of Minecraft stuff on YouTube, and 
none of the them had any useful information on how to perform the tricks they did. 
The videos are all either too old, or just lack any basic information that help you
get the thing your kids want. 

Minecraft is dumb. I hate it.

I hate it so much that I made this guide of guides on how to do some bullcrap that
I had to figure out on my own.

My heart goes out to you dads and moms of the world. You're not alone here.

These guides are meant to get you going and are brief and to the point. I hate
writing documentation as much as I hate Minecraft. 

You're welcome.
